# Overview on how to create a FAIR Implementation Profile

The FIP Wizard 3.0 is by now a stable and robust tool. However, as the FIP Wizard generates and relies on information that is open to the community at large, it requires some expert guidance in its use in order to ensure the quality of the output. This means that anyone who wishes to create a FIP should ﬁrst participate in a FIP Introduction workshop conducted by a **GFF qualiﬁed** [3PFF facilitator](https://osf.io/hvdcb). A major responsibility of the 3PFF facilitator is to curate newly created FERs to ensure the list of resources is uncluttered by duplicates or erroneous and useless nanopublications. If you are interested in GFF qualiﬁcation as a 3PFF facilitator, please email admin@gofair.foundation.

Making a FIP will typically involve three activities summarized below. The numbered chapters of this user guide will provide all the details you need to operate the FIP Wizard responsibly and with conﬁdence.

 
1.	**Completing the FIP Ǫuestionnaire:** Answer the questions of the FIP Wizard questionnaire by selecting for each FAIR Principle, the FAIR Enabling Resources from the drop-down lists, setting the implementation status, and stating your considerations behind that choice. Go to [Chapters 1](https://gofair-foundation.github.io/fip/GettingStarted.html) and [2](https://gofair-foundation.github.io/fip/CompletingQuestionnaire.html)!

  
2.	**Minting New Nanopublications:** When declaring your community as a FAIR Implementation Community (FIC) or when selecting FERs keep in mind that:
 
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; a.    Other communities may have provided answers that in some cases are not yet quality-checked by experts (those that have been checked are marked with a GFF badge).

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; b.    When the FICs and FERs you are looking for can not be found in the drop-down lists, you’ll have to mint new FICs and FERs as nanopublications (go to [Chapter 3](https://gofair-foundation.github.io/fip/MintingNanopublications.html)).

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; A few notes:

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;i.	Many resources might be already described in [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/), in which case you should reuse the metadata recorded in there.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;ii.	Typically, FERs of type Metadata-data-linking-mechanism (F3), Communication-protocol (A1.1), Authentication & Authorization Techniques (A1.2), a Knowledge-representation-language (I1) or Usage-license (R1.1) need to be described from scratch. This is true as well for “new” resources and “resources in development”.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;iii.	Minting new FERs with good metadata as nanopubs requires a deep understanding about the resource and the [FER types](www.brokenlink.org) to which it is assigned.
 

3.	**FIP Publication:** The FIP Wizard (the FIP Ǫuestionnaire and its drop-down lists and nanopublication features) can be seen as an editing tool, assisting you in the creation of your FIP. During the creation process and after you have completed your FIP, you can always search for your FIP within the “Project” list of the FIP Wizard, and view and revise it as you like. However, to make a deﬁnitive FIP that will be recognized by the community (including machines), you must also publish your FIP. This can also be done from the FIP Wizard, and involves a two-step process where you must ﬁrst compile the list of nanopublications as a single document (a trig ﬁle) and then submit this list to the FIP server (see [Chapter 4](https://gofair-foundation.github.io/fip/Publishing.html)).
