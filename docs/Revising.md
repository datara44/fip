# Revising your FIP

Changes in the FIP are automatically saved. 
There is no undo button for any action BUT you can use the version history button (26) which allows you to:
see all changes done by any editors
see details on each activity when clicking on it
by clicking on the three dots you see a menu with an option to revert to this version

If you want to answer a specific question later, click on the plus button to get a TODO reminder (27).
